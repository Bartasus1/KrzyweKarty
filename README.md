#Krzywe Karty - multiplayer card game
Developed by my friend as a board game, but due to it's complexity (was really hard to play - statistics were represented as a coins, so imagine exchanging coins after each attack), we decided to make it a video game.
As my first project it had it's ups and downs, but with each year I manage to rewrite more and more things to match my current skill level.
